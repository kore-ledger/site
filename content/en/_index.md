## What is Kore Ledger?
{.h1 .text-center}

**Kore Ledger** is a **Distributed Ledger Technology** (DLT) designed and built specifically for traceability of assets and processes' provenance and life cycle. It is complemented by a framework and governance model that facilitates interaction and cooperation between multiple actors in highly complex scenarios (circular economy, energy production, integral water cycle, agri-food production, etc.). The word **kore** means "green" in the African language Hausa, and represents one of its design principles: sustainability. Other principles, such as scalability to handle billions of transactions, the ability for nodes to run on low-resource devices, and multi-scheme cryptography to protect information and make it immune to manipulation, make **Kore Ledger** a strategic platform to achieve the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/).

## Why **Kore Ledger**?
{.h1 .text-center}

<font size=4>**Kore Leger** is the technology for digitizing traceability since it is based on a DLT infrastructure that allows building decentralized, secure, economical, and tamper-proof solutions with minimal environmental impact. This digitalization is the starting point for new circular and transparent value chains that reduce the use of materials and reuse or recycle products, reducing costs and creating less waste. It also allows companies to identify strategic opportunities in optimizing value chains, innovate much faster, minimize the impact of internal and external supply interruptions, and offer certification of more sustainable processes and products.</font>
