- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

{{< alert type="warning" title="CAUTION">}}
Tutorials assume that:
  - Docker service has elevated privilegies. If you have any trouble with it try using `sudo` or `su` utilities.
  - All required applications (cURL, Docker, Kore Tools and Git) are in the `$PATH` environment variable.
