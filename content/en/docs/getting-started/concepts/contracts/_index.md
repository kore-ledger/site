## Definition

A **contract** in **Kore Ledger** is the rules, agreements, and actions derived from said agreements executed in each event request of a **subject's life cycle**. In the same way that a **subject** always has an associated **schema**, which defines the set of properties of its state, said **schema** always has an associated **contract**. Changes in its **life cycle** occur exclusively through the execution of this **contract**.

## Structure

## Future work

In its definition, we limit ourselves exclusively to the term “**contract**,” compared to the name used in blockchain technologies of “smart contract,” to offer greater precision regarding its intentionality. The so-called “smart contracts” are neither contracts nor intelligent and are only programs that are executed under certain pre-established conditions. In our case, the objective is to offer a **contract** structure based on a formal language fundamentally inspired by the FCL (Formal Contract Language) proposal [1].
