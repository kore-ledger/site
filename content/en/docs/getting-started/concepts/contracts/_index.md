## Definition

A **contract** in **Kore Ledger** is the rules, agreements and actions derived from those agreements that are executed on each event request in the life cycle of a **subject**. Just as a **subject** always has an associated **schema**, which defines the set of properties of its state, such a **schema** always has an associated **contract**. Changes in its **life cycle** occur exclusively through the execution of this **contract**.

## Structure

## Future work

In its definition, we limit ourselves exclusively to the term "**contract**", as opposed to the denomination used in blockchain technologies of "smart contract", in order to provide greater precision on its intentionality. So-called "smart contracts" are not smart contracts and are just programs that are executed under certain pre-set conditions. In our case, the goal is to offer a **contract** structure based on a formal language fundamentally inspired by the proposed FCL (Formal Contract Language) [^1].
