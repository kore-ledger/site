## Bootstrap 
These are the nodes with which to establish a connection to the traceability network if an access license is available. They also provide [secure circuits](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/circuit-relay/) to communicate with the ephemeral nodes.

## Addressable
Nodes that require a public address. Governance can be created on them so that the ephemeral emits the corresponding events.

## Ephemeral 
These (which will normally be behind a NAT/Firewall) will be in charge of emitting events to the Bootstrap nodes.
