## What is a DLT?

**DLT** is an acronym for **Distributed Ledger Technology**. It is a concept that refers to a distributed database, which is replicated and synchronized on multiple network nodes and accessible by multiple parties. This technology allows us to store multiple identical copies of a record on different computers within a network, making it easy for multiple participants to consult and update it. This concept has attracted attention in the last decade because one of its variants, blockchain technology, underpins most cryptocurrencies.
