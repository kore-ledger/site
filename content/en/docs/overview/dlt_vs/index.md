## What is a DLT?

**DLT** is an acronym for **Distributed Ledger Technology**. This concept refers to a distributed database, which is replicated and synchronized across multiple network nodes and accessible to various parties. This technology allows us to store identical record copies on different computers, making it easy for multiple participants to view and update it. Unlike traditional distributed databases, it works like a ledger: only new records can be added, and old ones cannot be deleted or modified. This idea has attracted attention in the last decade because one of its variants, blockchain technology, underpins most cryptocurrencies.
