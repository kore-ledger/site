description: What is traceability and why is it so important?
---

The UNE 66.901-92 standard defines traceability as
>"the ability to reconstruct the history of use or location of an item or product using a registered identification"

- Traceability allows products and goods to be tracked as they move along the value chain, obtaining reliable information on the origin of inputs, supplier sourcing practices and transformation processes.
- It offers companies the ability to identify strategic opportunities in optimizing value chains, innovate much faster, minimize the impact of internal and external supply interruptions, and offer certification of more sustainable processes and products.
- The digitalization of traceability is the starting point for new circular and transparent value chains that reduce the use of materials, and that reuse or recycle products, reducing costs and creating less waste.
