description: The Kore Ledger Value Proposition.
---
Kore Ledger is the combination of the words "**green**” in the African language [“hausa”](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idioma_hausa), and “**ledger**”. It is a business initiative to provide the technology and framework necessary for the traceability of origin and life cycle of assets and processes.

The differentiating factor is that it will be done in a decentralized, secure and immune to manipulation manner, also guaranteeing the privacy of the data and the sustainability of the solutions. This approach provides a comprehensive, economical, easy-to-implement and non-invasive solution with the existing digitalization of our clients.

On the other hand, Kore Ledger technology offers the ability to link traceability information from different [subjects](../../getting-started/concepts/subjects/_index.md) and at different levels of their life cycle , which makes it the ideal solution in the field of circular economy, sustainable energy production, integral water cycle, carbon footprint, agri-food traceability, industrial safety, etc.

Kore Ledger offers the best technological infrastructure solution for the digitalization of asset and process traceability. Based on a secure distributed ledger technology that is immune to manipulation, it provides levels of scalability much higher than other equivalent solutions, and in a much more sustainable way.
1) Providing a solutions production line that drastically reduces the time and cost of launching solutions to the market.
2) Supported by a framework that facilitates the formalization of traceability models that satisfy the specific requirements of each client, offering an immediate return

With a technology designed for unlimited scalability, the ability to be executed on devices with limited resources (mobile, IoT,...), support for the most advanced cryptography and maximum energy efficiency.
