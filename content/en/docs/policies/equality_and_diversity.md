## Kore Ledger's Commitment to Equality and diversity
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Kore Ledger, S.L. declares its commitment to the establishment and development of policies that integrate equal treatment and opportunities between women and men, without direct or indirect discrimination based on sex, as well as the imposition and promotion of measures to achieve real equality within our organisation, establishing equal opportunities between women and men as a strategic principle of our Corporate and Human Resources Policy, in accordance with the definition of this principle established by the Organic Law 3/2007, of 22 March, for effective equality between women and men. 


In each and every one of the areas in which this company operates, from recruitment to promotion, including wage policy, training, working and employment conditions, occupational health, organisation of working time and work-life balance, we accept the principle of equal opportunities between women and men, paying special attention to indirect discrimination, which is understood as ‘the situation in which an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice places a person of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared to a person of the other sex’. 

With regard to communication, both internally and externally, all decisions taken in this respect will be reported and an image of the company will be projected in accordance with this principle of equal opportunities between women and men.  

The principles set out above will be put into practice through the promotion of equality measures or through the implementation of an Equality Plan that will lead to improvements with respect to the current situation, with the corresponding monitoring systems being set up, with the aim of making progress in achieving real equality between women and men in the company and, by extension, in society as a whole.

To this end, the legal representation of male and female workers will be involved, not only in the collective bargaining process, as established in Organic Law 3/2007 for effective equality between women and men, but also in the whole process of development and evaluation of the aforementioned equality measures or Equality Plan.
